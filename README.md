Yayyy!! Second script uploaded!! Feeling like a genius already! (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ)
This one was made in order to "fix" my first one. It's not like it works but it was supposed to ü§£

**The idea of it is:**

1. You start with 2 pre-saved names;
2. You can add up to 5 names;
3. when you reach 5 names, you can't save names anymore;
4. you should have the choice to delete all the names to free space(and restart the loop), or just let it this way and not add more names;
5. If you input other thing besides S/N (Y/N), you should have to write it again;
6. If you say that you don't want to add more names the script should end;

_actually realized that i broke my code one more time before uploading it and i don't remember what i did, i was at math class lol, so i edited my problems and matched them with my actual issues_

**I'm having these troubles:** 

1. When you reach 5 names, instead of directly showing you the option to erase it all or keep it, it asks you one more time if you want to add a new name;
2. Wrong answer thing is not happening;
3. Choosing to clean the list and restart the loop doesn't works, i don't have a clue about how to make the code "go back"
